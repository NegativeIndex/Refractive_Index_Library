# Refractive_Index_Library
Matlab function to calculate refractive index

## Files instruction

*getN_wl.m* is the mail funciton which will be called by the user to calculate the refractive index of various materials.

*calculate_refractive_index.m* is a script with examples to explain how to use *getN_wl* funciton.

*Organize_Data.m* is a script which convert the downloaded refractive index data into a better format. The original refractive index data were downloaded from the website [refractiveindex.info](https://refractiveindex.info/). The downloaded files are saved in the *WebRawData* folder. The converted files are saved in the *WebData* folder.

All other m-files are supportive functions. Especially, the files related to options (*options.m*, *getoption.m*, *setoption.m* and *option_example.txt*) were copied from internet and I forget where I got them. The copyright should beglong to the original authors. There functions work very well in my study.
